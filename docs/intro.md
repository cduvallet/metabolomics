## 1 Introduction

This document describes the process of going from open-source mzML mass
spectrometry files to aligned feature table(s). This is orchestrated by the script `raw2feats.py`. Each dataset folder must contain a machine-readable text file called a summary file which gives instructions to `raw2feats.py`. The format of this summary file, and all files required for MS processing, are described in this documentation.
