# metabolomics

This repo contains scripts to process metabolomics data.

You can find the documentation on [ReadTheDocs](http://untargeted-metabolomics-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

## MS Convert

- `ms_convert_tool.r` - Krista's R script that she used for converting files
- `msconvert_wrapper.py` - Claire's python script to convert files

## Processing data

- `raw2feats.py` - user-interfacing script that coordinates the processing. This is the script you should run to process your data.
- `preprocessing_mtab.py` - module with functions to process metabolomics data (most of these functions are calls to the R scripts)
- `align_peaks.R`, `pick_peaks.R` - R scripts which are called and actually do the processing
- `SummaryParserMtab.py` - module to parse summary file

#### To do
- clean up unnecessary files
